# Blog-Site

A simple blog site to practice basic Web Dev skills.

#

This blog site provides a basic outline of what a blog could look like. It is my very first project and so focuses more on the code being written and understanding concepts.

#

Tech stack : HTML, CSS, JavaScript
<br />
These technologies are used as they are the basis of front-end development and this project allowed me to utilise basic concepts of each.

#

Some challenges faced include:

<li> Design and layout
<li> Media queries and making the webpage responsive - currently only responsive to ~665px wide
<br />
<br />
Future implementations:
<li> Making it responsive for mobile devices (~360px wide)
<li> Improve on UX design

#

This project has 2 main features that can be trialed (the rest of the blog is responsive but has no major changes).
<br />
1st Feature:
<br />
In the footer of the webpage, click on the 'Sent a Request' button to view the pop-up form. 'X' button in the top right of the form can be used to clost the pop-up.
<br /><br />
Feature 2:
<br />
When webpage is reduced to < 1000px wide, the navbar links ('About', 'Blog' and 'Contact') will be hidden behind a menu button (3 parallel bars). This button can be clicked to reveal the navbar links.
